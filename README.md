# Hexapod-with-esp32
this is a custom control board for a six-legged (hexapod) robot. It’s built around the ESP32-S3 WROOM and uses two PCA9685 drivers to precisely control all servos. The robot can be easily controlled via a joystick, making movement intuitive and fun. Designed for DIY robotics projects and expandable with sensors or LEDs.
The 3D model of the hexapod IS NOT mine.I've adapted the 3D model for my PCB :)
